<p class="educate">Education can break the shackles of all misery.This is quite writly said.Learning is a process that shall continue throughout anyone's life.Learning shouln't be a burden but a process that enlightens you and motivates you to do better things in life.
Like reading this blog is one of them ;).Schooling ,often considered as a burden by children is an integral part of anyone's life.Without schooling, one can not appear for the formal exams and hence cannot futher obtain education.Rather then just siiting idle and doing nothing one should pickup a skill that the person likes and work on it. That is what learning is all about .
There are certain problems that may be encountered :
<ul>
  <li>Lack of time</li>
  <li>Lack of money</li>
  <li>Lack of support from your parents</li>
  <li>Lack of resources like proper studying material</li>
</ul>
But one should not lose hope.
There are proper organizations and institutions working towards teaching people a certain skill.
Skill India ,the campaign started by the government is quite an epitome of that.
